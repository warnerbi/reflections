How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    showed which lines contained the difference. A graphical tool like
    "Beyond Compare" would be much better"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can view past changes to see how the code functionality / bugs have
    progressed in time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With auto-save, have no control over logical appropriateness of commits.
    With manual-save, may tend to have too large of commits (laziness at doing
    commits at appropriate intervals).

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
